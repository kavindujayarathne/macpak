**macpak** ‚Äî Interactive wrapper that makes Homebrew much easier to use + zapper for non-brew apps (fzf-powered).  
It provides a fast, streamlined way to browse, install, and uninstall packages with additional cleanup helpers for non-brew software.  

Most macOS users rely on **Homebrew** as their primary package manager.  
While installing or uninstalling is just a single command, in practice these tasks often turn into multi-step workflows ‚Äî searching for the right package, checking its details with `brew info`, or listing installed packages before deciding what to remove.  

Uninstalls also leave behind leftovers since Homebrew doesn‚Äôt always remove everything.  
And for apps installed outside of Homebrew, dragging them to the Trash doesn‚Äôt clean up their hidden files either.  

**macpak** solves these problems by streamlining searches, installs, and uninstalls into an interactive workflow, while also handling non-brew apps with a zapper that removes both the application package and its leftovers in one go.  

For full guidance and configuration details, please check the [documentation](https://kavindujayarathne.com/blogs/macpak-documentation).
